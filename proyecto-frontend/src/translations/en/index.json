For example, using the Scrum framework, the project is divided into small subprojects with short delivery times: the 'sprint'. The result of the subprojects is not the final product, but it must be functional. Scrum also involves the 'daily meeting', the 'scrum master', etc.\n \n In addition to improving teamwork and increasing productivity, it is possible to improve the quality of the product and the customer experience by increasing the level of adaptation to unforeseen events or unexpected changes in customer requirements.\n \n The final project of the Fundació Esplai's bootcamp, with a duration of about 3-4 weeks, has been carried out in groups of 3 people using Scrum."
